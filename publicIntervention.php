			Get Framed NYC - Public Interaction Project
			</h1>
			
			<p>
			Emily Fuhrman, Shahrouz Varshabi and I set up a picture frame in various tourist locations around New York City to prompt people to take a picture in 
			a fun way, encourage them to interact with others and create a virtual record of the site.

			We started by collected data from six different locations in New York City: the Bethesda Fountain, the Central Park Mall,
			the Alice in Wonderland Statue, the Flatiron Building, Grand Central Station and Washington Square Park.

			Based on the type of people, the traffic, the congestion and the pace of each location we decided to focus on two locations: the Flatiron Building and Washington Square Park.  
			</p>
			
			<p>					
			To implement the project, we created three things: a frame mounted on a tripod, a twitter hashtag and a sign to graphically explain to passers by to take a picture and tweet it. 
			</p>

			At our first location, the Flatiron Building, we really struggled to get people to interact.  We tried moving the setup to different locations around the area but to no avail.  We eventually determined that the sign might be scaring people off, so we took it down.  Although we made the 
			sign to make the interaction more obvious and accessible, it had the opposite effect.  We came to the conclusion that it might have looked too corporate so people thought that there was an ulterior motive to the project.   
			</p>

			Once we moved to Washington Square Park, we had even greater success at getting people to interact.  The flow of pedestrians through the park funneled them past our setup.  Since we removed the 
			sign and because Washington Square Park is frequently a site for experiments and art projects, fewer people were put off and were instead drawn in.
