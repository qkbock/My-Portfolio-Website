			The USA Science and Engineering Festival is a national celebration of science held in Washington DC designed to excite the nationâ€™s youth.  
			It was important that the promotional material be exciting and engaging.  The design above was made into a poster which was presented as a gift to the 
			corporate sponsors.  I worked with the design firm Morris to create the layout and I cleaned up and placed all Illustrator logos.

			</p>		
			
			<p>For this graphic I took photos at the festival and then designed this layout to showcase the range of fun, interactive exhibits.  
			It was used to represented the Festival at the PR Newswire award ceremony for the best non-profit ad campaign.
